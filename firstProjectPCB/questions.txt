Do you need flyback diodes for the motors?
Yes, flyback diodes are necessary to protect the MOSFETs from the inductive kickback generated when the motor switches off. Without them, the MOSFETs could be damaged by the high voltage spikes.
How would you connect flyback diodes to a bi-directional load like a motor?
